## What do Users need?
- oauth only? 
- maybe email + pw too so that more private/anonymous users can be made (still need to try to corner this part of the market as much as possible over time)
- What are the columns I could have?
	- premium
	- stripe ID
	- username (so that maybe you could share your link for everyone to see your posts?)
	- private (default enabled - enable so that people who know your username can't see your account/posts)

Okay, so what are the actual basics:

- premium
- username

default to private - no teams exist, going to a link that's your username doesn't do anything (unless you're logged in AS that user?)

## What will the dashboard flow be?

Left rail: simple feed of your flashes

middle: preview of the selected flash
